### Voronoi Maps

A slight modification of Zetter's awesome Voronoi cell map of UK supermarkets, with New York State fire departments, with [data from New York State's Open Data Project](https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Directory-for-New-York-State/qfsu-zcpv)

This project can be used to generate [Voronoi maps](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/14/visualising-supermarkets-with-a-voronoi-diagram/) using D3 and Leaflet.

See an [explanation of the code](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/) and a [demo](http://chriszetter.com/voronoi-map/examples/uk-supermarkets/).
